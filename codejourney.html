    <h1>A journey through art history!</h1>
  </a>
Have you ever wanted to learn more about art history? Well, you've come to the right place!
remember that this is a brief overview of <b>some</b> of the popular movements of Western art history. 
It also mostly focuses on paitnings, but there is much scholarship on the sculptures/architectural sites of these periods as well. 
if you want to learn more about art outside the Western canon/more movements throughout time, I encourage your research!
