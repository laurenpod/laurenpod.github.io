    In fine art, the term "Antiquity" refers to the distant past, meaning the period between about 4,500 BCE (the beginnings of Western civilization) and about 450 CE (the beginning of the Middle Ages). The two principal civilizations of early Antiquity are those of Mesopotamia and Egypt. Other cultures include those of Ancient Persia (from 3,500 BCE):

    The more specific term "Classical Antiquity" is more common, however. This refers to the shorter period of classical civilization (c.1000 BCE - 450 CE), (other experts prefer the period 800 BCE - 450 CE), centered upon the cultures of Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome, as well as their prototypes (Aegean and Etruscan cultures) and derivatives (eg. the effect of Greek culture on Turkey, Persia, Central Asia, India and Egypt, a process known as Hellenism; Celtic culture, Early Christian culture).
